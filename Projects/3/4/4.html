                <h2>Overview of the Game</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                  The game can be played by 1 or 2 players in the age range of 23-50 years. It takes approximately 30-45 minutes to complete the game. The basic premise of this game is to combat the currently prevalent problem of smartphone-addiction. This addiction has harmful consequences not just on the physical and mental health, but also on the social relationships. People get so engrossed in their cell phones that they tend to move away from their families. The goal of this game is to overcome the addiction in a playful manner and get you closer to your family. The game presents several challenges which are basically conflicting situations wherein you have to make a decision between tasks that require you to re-focus your attention from cell-phones to the family’s needs.
                </p>
                <h2>Components of the Game</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                  The game consists of two die, four pegs, twelve colored challenge cards (two each of red, orange, purple, yellow, green and blue) and a gameboard.
                </p>
              

<br>
<br>


<h2>Rules of Play</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                  The player will roll the dice and start playing the game when number 6 shows up. The play progresses according to the number that comes up on the dice.
 </p>
 <p>
When the peg reaches a square where there is a ladder, it implies that the peg will either go up or down depending on your position. Both the directions (upward and downward) of the ladder have to be taken into account.
 </p>
 <p>
   

When the peg reaches a square where there is a snake’s face, then it means that the player will be presented with a challenge card. The card will have two conflicting tasks and the player has to make a decision between the two situations. Depending on the task selected, the outcomes will vary which will be revealed after you have made a decision.
  </p>
  <p>
    

The game is considered to be complete when the player has collected all six challenge cards which could be even before reaching the last square. In case, you reach the last square where there is number 100 before collecting all the six different colored cards, then keep playing until you collect them all. The player becomes a winner as soon as he collects all the six different colored cards. When 2 players are playing, then the winner is the one who gets all six cards faster.
   </p><p>
The six cards signify that you are capable of overcoming smartphone addiction by making the choices at that bring you closer to your family. Keep playing till you are a winner not just in the game but also in life. Enjoy the game and don’t forget that family is the most important part of one’s life.
